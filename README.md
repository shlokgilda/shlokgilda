# `$ whoami`

PhD Candidate @ University of Florida | Graduating May 2026
Research: **NLP × Cybersecurity** | Open-Source Security | Misinformation Detection

I build ML systems that keep software safe and detect when humans get toxic online. Currently working on understanding how communication dynamics shape vulnerability management in open-source projects (because turns out, the way devs talk to each other matters for security).

## `$ cat research.log`

**Thesis:** *How Communication Dynamics Shape Vulnerability Management in Open-Source Software*

**Current Projects:**
- 🔍 Analyzing OSS repositories to predict vulnerabilities through developer communication patterns
- 🧠 Building neuro-symbolic frameworks for validated knowledge graph extraction from Cyber Threat Intel
- 🎯 Detecting subtle toxicity in online conversations (the kind humans miss but ML catches)

**Published Work:** 8 conference papers • 1 US Patent • [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZJ-NR-sAAAAJ&hl=en)

**Recent Highlight:** Co-first author on Best Paper Award at SocialSec 2023
*"People Still Care About Facts: Twitter Users Engage More with Factual Discourse than Misinformation"*
